        <h2>Help</h2>
        
        <p>Our site generator will automate the process of creating our course Web site to greatly reduce the
amount of time needed in planning a semester and update it as it progresses. In order to do that our
application will provide a Web site template that all generated content will use where user entered data
can be store in JSON files that can then be loaded using JavaScript.
