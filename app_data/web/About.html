        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>University courses are required to provide course materials at the start of a term that help students
            understand course requirements and plan their semesters. These come in the form of a course syllabus
            and schedule that list information like course policies and dates for exams and assignments. Many times
            instructors find the most convenient means to disseminate this information is by way of a course Web
            site. Course Web sites are typically published at the start of a semester and are updated as it progresses.
            Such a site keeps the students up to date on deadlines and provides a place for instructors to distribute
            things like lecture slides and assignments.</p>
            <p>Places like Stony Brook University’s Computer Science Department have long required a Course Web
            Site for each taught course, and so every semester, the instructors teaching these courses generate and
            update this content. This process can be time consuming and tedious. In addition, many times instructors
            have more important things to do than build beautiful sites, and the result is each course Web site looks
            different, making it difficult for students to find the content they are after as they navigate differently
            arranged structures.</p>
            <p>But why use course sites at all? Why not just use a tool like Blackboard for organizing course content?
            Well, sites like that have their own difficulties. They require time consuming login and navigation
            processes, they do many things, and so many things interfere with the quick retrieval for what a student
            is looking for, and they are general purpose sites, and so are cluttered with many things a course isn’t
            even using. For an instructor, building and maintaining a custom course Web page still provides the best
            service to its students.</p>
            <p>The Course Site Generator application intends to automate the process of building and updating a
            course Web site in one easy to use tool. The sites produced by this application will look good and will
            be customizable in many different ways but will exist within a common site and page structure
